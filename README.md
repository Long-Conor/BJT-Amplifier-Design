# EEET2600 - Electronics Project Assignment

## BJT-Amplifier-Design: 
* The main objective of the project focuses on designing and analysing the design of single-stage BJT Amplifier
* Applying bias processing techniques of DC bias and AC bias, and then perform data analysis of the circuit design
* Utilizing NI Multisim for schematic design and circuit simulation with theoretical value as well as real-value for components implementation
